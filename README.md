This program compares calculation time for 5 sorting algorithms:
- merge sorting
- heap sorting
- bubble sorting
- counting sorting
- quick list sorting.
    
Results of the comparison are presented in the table. Example is shown below:

       Length list       |    10    |    20    |    30    |    40    |    50    
      Merge sorting     |   16.9   |   29.6   |   47.0   |   80.2   |   81.8   
       Heap sorting      |   18.0   |   38.6   |   64.6   |  130.5   |  115.6   
      Bubble sorting     |   13.0   |   40.2   |   86.4   |  142.9   |  215.9   
     Counting sorting    |   73.9   |   83.7   |   87.2   |  103.7   |  103.8   
    Quick list sorting   |   10.4   |   19.5   |   30.8   |   41.9   |   58.6   
    
Moreover reasults are presented in the form of a graph. (https://i.ibb.co/mGnKZt8/Figure-1.png)
Each tests results are also save to file.

Project shows implementation of algorithms, useage of functions, lists, modules, decorators, exceptions, file operation, unittests, presenting the results.
